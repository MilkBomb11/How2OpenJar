		<h2>▶Tales about the Jar</h2>

		<h3>1. John and the Jar</h3>
		<p>There once lived a boy named John. At that time, a jar was living in the dark <br>forest next to John's town, eating anybody who entered the forest.<br> So John decided to kill the jar using a homemade nuclear bomb he made. <br>That's how everybody in the town, including the jar was deleted from the world. The end.</p>
		<h3>2. Jar Battles</h3>
		<p>In the future where peoople captured wild jars and made them battle each other,<br> onced lived a girl named Fionna. She captured a jar named Jarmander, which was a dragon type jar.<br> She used fire blast, but pronounced weirdly, which made jar explode, ending the world and stuff.</p>
